Usage & Verification
Go to Reddit.
Find a subreddit with many  Redgif videos.
Important: Click anywhere on the page first. Chrome often blocks auto-playing audio until the user has interacted with the document at least once.
Scroll down.
Expected: As a video enters the center of your screen (approx 75% visible), it should auto-play and unmute.
Scroll past the video.
Expected: The video should pause (stop).
Troubleshooting
Audio not starting? Make sure you clicked on the page. Some browsers have strict autoplay policies.
Videos not detecting? The extension looks for standard <video> tags. Some Reddit ads or embedded players (like YouTube embeds) might not be controlled by this simple script.
